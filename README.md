# LeetCode Problem Solving Journey

Hello welcome to my repo! This repo will contain a list of solved LeetCode problems that I have solved. I will separate each LeetCode problem into a different directory/folder to make things more organized.

## Each file will contain the following

1. A idea.md to document the thought process of initial ideas, updates on if
it can be done in any other way. Finally it will end on researching the most 
"optimal" solution on the internet and give thoughts on the advantage and disadvantage of each method.
2. one or more .CPP file for each solution. To keep things organized it might 
be best to just have a separate .CPP file for each solution, so that it could be read easily.
3. The Template directory is used to make copies of the folder for faster workflow. Rather than creating a new directory with all the boilerplate all the time for leetcode I figured this would help in the long run.

### Quality Of Life Improvement (To-Do list)

- [ ] create a short script that each time a new directory is created
  it will automatically update the main README.md file as a counter
  to represent the amount of problems solved.
