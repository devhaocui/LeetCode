# LeetCode Problem Solving Journey

Hello welcome to my repo! This repo will contain a list of solved LeetCode problems that I have solved. I will separate each LeetCode problem into a different directory/folder to make things more organized.

## Each file will contain the following

1. A idea.md to document the thought process of initial ideas, updates on if it can be done in any other way. Finally it will end on researching the most "optimal" solution on the internet and give thoughts on the advantage and disadvantage of each method.
2. one or more .CPP file for each solution. To keep things organized it might be best to just have a separate .CPP file for each solution, so that it could be read easily.

The idea is to force the inconvenience of having to create a separate idea.md to pursue longer duration of thinking time rather than just typing out some very rough idea using comments in the same .CPP files.
