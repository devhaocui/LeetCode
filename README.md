# LeetCode Journey

- Hello welcome to my repo! This repo will contain a list of solved
LeetCode problems that I have solved. I will separate each LeetCode
problem into a different directory/folder to make things more organized.

## Each file will contain the following

1. A `idea.md` to document the thought process of initial ideas,
solutions and final remarks of what I've learned in the process.

2. one or more `.CPP` file for each solution. To keep things organized
it might be best to just have a separate .CPP file for each solution,
so that it could be read easily.

3. The `Template directory` is used to make copies of the folder
for faster workflow. Rather than creating a new directory with
all the boilerplate all the time for leetcode I figured this
would help in the long run.

4. An example of each `idea.md` that's in every directory

## What This Repository is NOT

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo is based on my journey and often times might not contain the
  absolute "Optimal" solutions. But what I will promise is there will
  not be any solutions that do not pass the test cases.
